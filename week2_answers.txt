Note that I just used the base_app for this week.

OK so for random app ideas:

1.) Assuming you can stick files up and link them in a similar fashion, some sort of a collaberative site
2.) I was thinking of building a tax provision reasonableness evaluation tool (for auditors to evaluate the tax provision calculated by clients)
3.) A site similar to zombo.com, or sad trombone.
